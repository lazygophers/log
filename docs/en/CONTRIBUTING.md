## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project and all participants are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to abide by this code.

## 🔄 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

### Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch from `master`
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Test** thoroughly under all build tags
6. **Submit** a pull request

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Go 1.21+** - [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
-   **Git** - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
-   **Make** (optional but recommended)

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/log.git
cd log

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lazygophers/log.git

# 4. Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# 5. Verify installation
make test-quick
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Set Go environment (if not already set)
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

# Optional: Install useful tools
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
```

## 💻 Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

-   Follow Go best practices: [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
-   Use meaningful variable and function names
-   Keep functions small and focused
-   Write self-documenting code

### Specific Standards

-   **Code Style**: Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting
-   **Error Handling**: Use proper error wrapping and context
-   **Logging**: Use the project's logging package appropriately
-   **Concurrency**: Follow Go concurrency patterns safely

### Build Tags

Some features may be conditionally compiled using build tags:

-   `dev`: Development features
-   `test`: Testing utilities
-   `bench`: Benchmarking tools

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests quickly (without race detection)
make test-quick

# Run tests with race detection
make test-race

# Run tests for a specific package
make test-pkg pkg=github.com/lazygophers/log
```

### Writing Tests

-   Write unit tests for all new functionality
-   Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
-   Follow the existing test patterns
-   Test both success and failure cases

### Coverage

```bash
# Generate test coverage
make test-coverage

# View coverage report
make test-coverage-view
```

## 🏷️ Build Tag Requirements

When adding features that should be conditionally compiled:

1. Use descriptive build tag names
2. Document build tags in the README
3. Ensure backward compatibility
4. Test with and without the build tag

## 📚 Documentation

### API Documentation

Update GoDoc comments for any public API changes:

```go
// LogLevel represents the severity level of a log message
// Example:
//     logger.SetLevel(log.InfoLevel)
type LogLevel int
```

### User Documentation

Update the appropriate documentation files for:

-   New features
-   API changes
-   Configuration options
-   Usage examples
