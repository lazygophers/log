# 📋 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### ✅ Encouraged Behaviors

-   **Showing empathy and kindness to others**
-   **Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences**
-   **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**
-   **Taking responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
-   **Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community**
-   **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
-   **Acknowledging contributions** of all sizes
-   **Helping newcomers** get started and feel welcome

### ❌ Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   **Discrimination**: Discriminatory remarks or behavior against any protected group
-   **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
-   **Spam**: Excessive or irrelevant posting, or commercial advertising
-   **Off-topic Content**: Persistently posting content unrelated to the project
-   **Other Behavior**: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Community Spaces Include

-   **GitHub repositories** and all related spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
-   **Official communication channels** (Discord, Slack, email lists)
-   **Project social media** accounts and posts
-   **Project events** (conferences, meetups, workshops)
-   **Documentation** and other official project materials

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Reporting

Instances of abuse, harassment, or other unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement:

-   **Primary Contact**: support@lazygophers.com
-   **GitHub Issues**: For public violations, you can report via GitHub Issues
-   **Private Reports**: For sensitive matters, please contact us directly via email

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Response Timeline

-   **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
-   **Initial Response**: Within 72 hours
-   **Resolution**: Within 1-2 weeks (complex cases may take longer)

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, clearly describing the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example Actions**:

-   Private message explaining the issue
-   Request to edit or delete problematic content
-   Temporary restriction to specific project areas

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example Actions**:

-   Written warning with specific behavioral expectations
-   Temporary restriction from community participation
-   Monitoring of future contributions

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration**: Typically 1-3 months, depending on severity

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeal Process

If you believe you have been sanctioned incorrectly, you may appeal by:

1. **Sending an email** to support@lazygophers.com within 30 days
2. **Providing** a detailed reason for the appeal
3. **Including** any relevant evidence or background information
4. **Waiting** for review by a different group of community leaders

Appeals will be reviewed within 2-3 weeks, and the decision will be final.
