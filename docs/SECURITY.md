- **Monitor Advisories**: Subscribe to our security mailing list and GitHub security advisories
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow our security hardening guidelines
- **Regular Updates**: Apply security updates within 48 hours of release for critical issues
- **Version Pinning**: Use specific version numbers in production, not version ranges
- **Security Scanning**: Regularly scan your applications and dependencies for vulnerabilities

#### Log Security & Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, API keys, tokens, PII, or financial information
- **Data Classification**: Implement data classification policies for log content
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize and validate all user input before logging
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode log output to prevent injection attacks
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls for log files and directories
- **Encryption**: Encrypt log files containing any sensitive operational data
- **Retention Policies**: Implement appropriate log retention and deletion policies
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain audit trails for log file access and modifications

#### Build & Deployment Security
- **Checksum Verification**: Always verify package checksums and signatures
- **Official Sources**: Download only from official GitHub releases or Go module proxy
- **Dependency Management**: Use `go mod verify` and dependency scanning tools
- **Build Tags**: Use appropriate build tags for your security requirements:
  - Production: `release` tag for optimized, secure builds
  - Development: `debug` tag for enhanced debugging (never in production)
  - High-Security: `discard` tag for maximum performance and minimal attack surface
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verify the integrity of the entire dependency chain

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Log Aggregation**: Use secure log aggregation systems with proper authentication
- **Network Security**: Ensure log transmission uses encrypted channels (TLS 1.3+)
- **Storage Security**: Store logs in secure, access-controlled storage systems
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt and secure log backups with appropriate retention
